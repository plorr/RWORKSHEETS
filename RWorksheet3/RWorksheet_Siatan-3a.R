#WORKSHEET-3 in R

#1. There is a built-in vector LETTERS contains the uppercase letters of the alphabet
#and letters which contains the lowercase letters of the alphabet.

#LETTERS

## [1] "A" "B" "C" "D" "E" "F" "G" "H" "I" "J" "K" "L" "M" "N" "O" "P" "Q" "R" "S"
## [20] "T" "U" "V" "W" "X" "Y" "Z"

#letters

## [1] "a" "b" "c" "d" "e" "f" "g" "h" "i" "j" "k" "l" "m" "n" "o" "p" "q" "r" "s"
## [20] "t" "u" "v" "w" "x" "y" "z"



###Based on the above vector LETTERS.

  #a. You need to produce a vector that contains the first 11 letters.
first <- LETTERS [1:11]
first

##ANS [1] "A" "B" "C" "D" "E" "F" "G" "H" "I" "J" "K"

  #b. Produce a vector that contains the odd numbered letters.

odd_nums <- LETTERS[seq (1,26,2)] 
odd_nums

##ANS [1] "A" "C" "E" "G" "I" "K" "M" "O" "Q" "S" "U" "W" "Y"

  #c. Produce a vector that contains the vowels.

vowels <- LETTERS [c (1, 5, 9, 15, 21)]
vowels

##ANS [1] "A" "E" "I" "O" "U"

###Based on the above vector letters:

  #d. Produce a vector that contains the last 5 lowercase letters.

lower <- letters
lower [22:26]

##ANS [1] "v" "w" "x" "y" "z"

  #e. Produce a vector that contains letters between 15 to 24 letters in lowercase.

let <- letters [16:23]

#Iloilo City, Tacloban, Samal Island, and Davao City. The average temperature in celcius are 
#42, 39, 34, 34, 30, and 27 degrees.

  #a. What is the R code and its result for creating a character vector for the city/town of
#Tuguegarao City, Manila, Iloilo City, Tacloban, Samal Island, and Davao City? Name the
#object as city. The names should follow the same order as in the instruction.
